# groggle

I wanted to play with DMX-capable hardware. So I took my favorite music, threw
it at FFTW3 and produced some DMX data from the result. (Yeah, sounds simple
at first. :))

By now, *groggle* can also grab a live audio stream and work on that one. Useful
for hooking a sound card in between the Apple TV and the stereo... ;)

## Side Constraints
- Apply modern C++ where useful.
- Don't use Qt (I work with it on a daily basis, it is great, but sometimes you need to see plain ANSI C++.)

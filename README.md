# groggle

I wanted to play with DMX-capable hardware. So I took my favorite music, threw
it at FFTW3 and produced some DMX data from the result. (Yeah, sounds simple
at first. :))

By now, *groggle* can also grab a live audio stream and work on that one. Useful
for hooking a sound card in between the Apple TV and the stereo... ;)

Side constraints: Don't use Qt (I work with it on a daily basis, it is great,
but sometimes you need to see plain ANSI C++.) and try to make the code look
not too much OOP but maybe a little like functional code.
